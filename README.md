📧 Email Validation Program 

This is a simple Python program that validates an email address using a regular expression (regex). The program asks the user to enter an email and checks whether it follows a standard email format.

How It Works

The user inputs an email address.

A regex pattern checks whether the email format is valid.

The program prints "valid email" if it matches the pattern, otherwise "invalid email".
